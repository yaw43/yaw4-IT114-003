I was traveling through space in my <adjective> spaceship when I landed on <planet>.
The aliens there were <adjective> and <verb_ending_in_ing> around a <object>.
One of them handed me a <adjective> <object> and said, "<gibberish_phrase>!"
I had no idea what it meant, but I took it and <verb_past_tense> back to my spaceship.
